JetBlue and American Airlines say they will comply with the ban
@snewstrom Sorry to hear you're frustrated, Stephanie. Overhead bins are shared space and not guaranteed. It is common for our inflight crewmembers to store needed items in the bins above row 1.
@JetBlue Do better! Flight 2384. 2 of us in row 1 (mosaic/1st to board). Crew and individuals that needed extra assistance put luggage in 1st overhead so we no space until row 4. Asked FA. He said he needs his items close and he can‚Äôt control where others place things. Insane!
@HappyMegzz @juliamichaels @JetBlue I did... Thank you! üòò
@megalodonna @juliamichaels @JetBlue Thank you, Bubby! It was magical... She made me forget my aches &amp; troubles for 1 &amp; 1/2 hrs! I was that close &amp; she held my hand twice! üéâüé∂‚ù§ https://t.co/36hQt9qQyw
@burgessct @SecurelyTravel @JetBlue @AmericanAir @StateDept Glad I jumped in and went to Cuba last summer before this madness. What a great place - people were so warm and welcoming. Stray dogs are all bathed, immunized and ready for adoption, like this one. Culture, music, art, Catholic Churches all incredible. https://t.co/OsRz3XptIn
Okay folks...I made my pitch on Jet Blue's website for STL to be added to their flight route. Please do the same. @Bayer @ExpressScripts @BeldenEC @enterprisecares @Emerson_News @BryanCaveatWork @EDAllianceSTL @RBCStLouis @STLRegChamber @SigmaAldrich @Square @WWTworldwide https://t.co/uLxEz0vGyB

@montana_fame @rondo_ix @celtics @JetBlue Yes, because 25 points is bad? Irving scores 50 on a team with nobody else, and lost. Good for him. We don‚Äôt care.
Love JetBlue excellent flight
@iankar_ That‚Äôs literally exactly as much as David Neeleman has raised to start Moxy (name not final).  You know, the guy who started Morris Air (which is what became Southwest), WestJet, and JetBlue.

State Dept. said JetBlue flights to Santa Clara in central Cuba &amp; the eastern cities of Holguin, Camaguey would be banned starting in December.  American Airlines flights to Camaguey, Holguin &amp; Santa Clara, beach resort of Varadero &amp; the city of Santiago are also being banned.
Stop cancelling your damn flights! JetBlue (this is a test yhacks2019)

Deceptive activity @JetBlue Flight attendant announces on 2 separate flights that if apply  on-board for @Barclays credit card - receive 40,000 @JetBlue bonus points. No annual fee - only to receive 20,000, saying flight attendant ‚Äúmisspoke‚Äù These are LIES to get people to apply

Thanks to @JetBlue for seating us together without us having to ask after @AerLingus had separated us for connecting flight. Small issue but very welcome. Plenty of legroom, great service, free wifi...Highly recommend flying with @JetBlue !
@1aleshalou Hello! Yes, our flights from New Orleans are departing today.
@JetBlue are flights from New Orleans still leaving?
@JetBlue I‚Äôm trying to create a TrueBlue account for my 7yr old child. You require a child to have their own email address &amp; don‚Äôt accept the parent‚Äôs email. I‚Äôm told to create a free address for the child. @AmericanAir didnt require this and accepts the parent email. Ridiculous.

@thecoopertom Holy crap! On jetBlue I at least got free (warm) soda pop...
@wkrtsinwndrlust We appreciate your suggestion, Julie. We'll pass it along.üòä

@wkrtsinwndrlust Good morning! We've issued that credit for you and it's in your Travel Bank.
I just landed in NYC from SJ and i have to be honest Korey, Kecia and Ana on Flight 760 made it a memorable experience. @JetBlue Thank you to the caring lady who fed me with her own food because i hadn't had time to grab food the whole day prior the flight. i'm officially a JB RN

It isn‚Äôt easy being in the airline business, but airlines have one advantage over a traditional company. Their assets are mobile. If a carrier like @JetBlue discovers softness in one region, it can move its airplanes elsewhere. https://t.co/qE60sQwe9u
@JetBlue Looks like it's just my bad luck today LOL. I'll be okay.

@jeffkatzshow Oh no! Please reach out to your inflight crew. They'll reset the system, move you to seat with a working TV, or issue a credit for the inconvenience.

@JoelCPeterson I dropped @JetBlue many moons ago in 2006 because they failed to honor their #PassengerBillOfRights after my flight back to San Diego from NY was stuck on the tarmac for 59 minutes (as opposed to 60) and couldn‚Äôt taxi to a gate because runway traffic was obstructing our path.
@JetBlue Thank you @JetBlue for the great customer service as always. My favorite airline to fly!
@theChrisDo @JetBlue They are doing what @garyvee was advocating in his book ‚ÄúThe Thank You Economy‚Äù   Even though the book might be considered old, the principle still applies today.
