JetBlue Crew members just let us know that we are delayed another hour.  3pm now.  SpiritAirlines is even looking good at this point.  #Yikes
angelapitter Hi, Angela. We're sorry to hear your anniversary celebration plans have been affected by a delay. We'd like to take a closer look. Please send us the confirmation code and your full name via DM.
Wow - I’m not having a great first time experience with JetBlue my flight that was scheduled for 10:20am departure got moved to 12:45, then 2, and now 3PM. This is ridiculous! Get us to our destination already.
Oh no JetBlue just updated flt #1877 from 2pm to 3pm ... shall I cut my losses or try the 9pm flight which has mint????
AskBarclaysUS Why I haven’t received the 40,000 bonus points I’m supposed to get with my Barclays jetblue card?? I already spend and payed of the $1,000 balance requiered in purchases.
sp7988 JetBlue Delta They gave me a bag of cheezits and a sprite.  #BringOutTheBooze
Ok JetBlue this is me before you sent my flight #1877 back to the gate.... now #SpoilerAlert - this is my 28th anniversary.... really didn’t think I’d spend it BostonLogan .. and probably likely to miss my Cirque show at 7pm .. https://t.co/bKPS6Ba5u0
JetBlue Countdown to my exciting getway on Wed night to FLL
MikeBoard1200 PratteInSAT JetBlue Would make SAT to JFK, BOS, FLL and LAX even more competitive and close the fare price gap we have with AUS rn.   So, if you have to pick one thing for SAT to strive for, it's that!
EricElander JetBlue That’s all? The ONE time Delta was delayed bc of something out of their control, they not only offered us all free lunch but offered us skymiles or free refunds for those who missed events.  Meanwhile JetBlue can’t even give you a pack of skittles. #SwitchToDelta
geekproduction Our Fly-Fi is free and fast and strong enough for streaming. See you soon! https://t.co/FIDCMLknKi
MrBeastYT IAmAlanWalker JetBlue you guys should donate and spread the word!!
JetBlue 2958 to jfk. And I’m uncomfy, yes, but I’m much more concerned about the pilot and crew! Really not okay to make them work in such high temperatures.
JetBlue The really sweet ladies near me are going to miss their non-refundable JourneyOfficial show tonight.  They were relying on you, JetBlue.  Forgive us for not believing you you’re doing everything you can do.
JetBlue whenever I fly on JetBlue I always like to know the Name of my plane ✈️ anyone else???

hey JetBlue i have a random question, on the a321 planes how strong is the wifi on board? flying to cali next week and im thinking of trying to stream while flying from logan to lax, thank you for putting up with my random question, and cant wait for next week!
mgirdley PratteInSAT JetBlue Frankly just getting JetBlue here would be a huge win.
RachelFeltman Sorry to hear you're uncomfortable, Rachel. What is your flight number?
JetBlue Hi. Any updates regarding today’s 3:16 flt out of Providenciales? Thanks
JetBlue What does it mean
JetBlue you have any extra tickets, so I can help protect this house?

JetBlue JetBlue I’d prefer you drew a plane for all of us here  BOS in the midst of a 3+ hour delay.
JetBlue Wtf is this
RachelFeltman JetBlue jonronson just reading through your Concorde story and this came up on my timeline. Confused me a little!
Apparently the auxiliary power unit used to cool the cabin and cockpit just...doesn’t exist on this plane and JetBlue doesn’t care. Anyway I have been asked by our pilot to complain so I gotta complain!!! What stage of capitalism is this
EricElander We know you have important places to be, and we apologize for the frustration. We're working to get you on your way as quickly as possible.
JetBlue tdgarden NHLBruins Can’t wait to hear todd_angilly sing the anthem tonite 🇺🇸!!
JetBlue .JetBlue is drunk.
JetBlue Good job!
ClintPHenderson ABC7NY JFKairport JetBlue That's Why I drive
My flight just kicked off with our pilot apologizing for the sweltering heat on the plane, telling us it would get hotter, and asking us to please tell JetBlue to stop making him fly under these conditions lololol
It’s the tdgarden, home of the NHLBruins, if you can’t tell.

JetBlue JetBlue If safety is your biggest concern, why load hundreds of people on a plane that had to be towed from the runway back to the gate?  #JetBlue #Delay #Unreliable #ihavetogettowork
“We've taken quick action and are redeploying capacity to manage demand in the impacted markets.\" https://t.co/rsbAIPdJaN
JetBlue Thank you I'll look out for the email and stay on top of the situation 🤙🏽
PratteInSAT Yep.   Evergreen wishlist:  - Nonstop service: BOS, OAK - Increased route competition: LAS, SFO - Increased frequency: MIA, BWI, MEX  And jetblue to JFK/BOS/FLL. #brokenrecord
SHERUARORA We understand this is frustrating. Compensation is determined after take off. You will receive more information via email if your flight qualifies for compensation. You can learn more here: https://t.co/D1kbLRelij.
JetBlue #675 its opened up and I'm gonna board because i need to be somewhere. But my plans are mucked and Saturday lost. So I'm gonna lay the cards out and say a percentage back or travel voucher wouldn't go unappreciated.  Few things suck more than losing time.
JetBlue Safety is and should absolutely be your priority..   Having a safe plane READY for the hundreds of people you boarded onto that plane!  Why wait until we are all boarded and on the plane to make sure it’s safe if it’s your priority?  My inner Karen is coming out.  #Karen #JetBlue
JetBlue 2.5 hour delay because no other plane.  No guarantee of getting out of here today.  WTF.  Not even enough seats in terminal for our entire flight either.  #Nightmare #JetBlue
EricElander We apologize for the inconvenience, Eric. Safety is our Number One priority! We show your flight departing at 2PM, and our airport crewmembers will update with any new information.
EricElander Delta JetBlue Yeah delta is the way to go dude
EricElander Delta JetBlue This was your biggest mistake. Delta&gt;JetBlue
All my coworkers said to join them on their Delta flight, but I wanted to be loyal to JetBlue.  My mistake apparently.  #FoolMeOnce
SHERUARORA What is your flight number, Sheru? If your flight is delayed, you can change or cancel your booking without penalty, though the delayed flight is often still the earliest available option.
JetBlue y’all plan on updating your headphone ports orrrrr???
Precision_Risk travel tips watch for these chairs in HobbyAirport = recline.  JetBlue  ticket counter!    A favorite! https://t.co/Ho26jch1vc
Its obnoxious to keep us here twiddling our thumbs without giving us the option to try another flight, airport, or refund. If you wanna play the 5hr waiting game go ahead, but customer service always wins and rn, ur service sucks JetBlue. #makeitright
At the airport, checking my 92 lbs suitcase:  JetBlue Employee: You didn’t have to pack your husband in your bag! Me: haha! Oh no, I would’ve had to chop him up to get him in there. JetBlue Employee: ... Me: ...
EricElander We're sorry to hear your flight has experienced disruptions. What's your flight number? We'll take a closer look.
JetBlue missing my meeting in Las Vegas because of a plane that was deemed unsafe.  Always fun boarding a plane, sitting for 90 minutes then being delayed hours.  #JetBlue #JetBlueFlashFares #unreliable

JetBlue As you can imagine I fly a lot. First time I have experienced this as your team members are normally friendly and understand that the customer comes first. Not this flight.
Starting in December, JetBlue and American Airlines flights to Santa Clara, Holguin and Camaguey in Cuba would be banned. https://t.co/oejrjRltU1

JetBlue and American Airlines say they will comply with the ban
snewstrom Sorry to hear you're frustrated, Stephanie. Overhead bins are shared space and not guaranteed. It is common for our inflight crewmembers to store needed items in the bins above row 1.
JetBlue Do better! Flight 2384. 2 of us in row 1 (mosaic/1st to board). Crew and individuals that needed extra assistance put luggage in 1st overhead so we no space until row 4. Asked FA. He said he needs his items close and he can’t control where others place things. Insane!
HappyMegzz juliamichaels JetBlue I did... Thank you! 😘

Love JetBlue excellent flight
iankar_ That’s literally exactly as much as David Neeleman has raised to start Moxy (name not final).  You know, the guy who started Morris Air (which is what became Southwest), WestJet, and JetBlue.
