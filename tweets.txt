JetBlue Crew members just let us know that we are delayed another hour.  3pm now.  SpiritAirlines is even looking good at this point.  #Yikes
angelapitter Hi, Angela. We're sorry to hear your anniversary celebration plans have been affected by a delay. We'd like to take a closer look. Please send us the confirmation code and your full name via DM.
Wow - Iâ€™m not having a great first time experience with JetBlue my flight that was scheduled for 10:20am departure got moved to 12:45, then 2, and now 3PM. This is ridiculous! Get us to our destination already.
